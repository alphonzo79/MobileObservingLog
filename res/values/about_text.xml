    <string name="about_text">The Mobile Astronomical Observing Log is meant to provide an easy, convenient way to log astronomical observations, even while in the field. The night mode option is customized as much as possible to protect dark adaptation.\n
\n
Each object page includes a star chart with 1, 2 and 4 degree circles like those used on some finders. Basic information about the object is given, as well as fields for logging information about the observation.\n
\n
The application is open-source and is distributed under the MIT License, which may be viewed at http://www.opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n

Data for objects in the NGC and IC catalogs was compiled from resources made publicly available through the NGC/IC Project LLC and is used with its permission - http://www.ngcic.org\n
