* This a list of things I will consider doing.  I do not mean this list as something I will work on.

What I will not do:
 - Nothing yet (I will add to this as needed)

Things to know:
 - This is a first attempt at an independant development project. I am using this as an educational exercise to learn both Android development and Java. Feedback is welcome on the finer points that I have understandably overlooked
 - Public issues are tracked on the GitHub project: https://github.com/alphonzo79/MobileObservingLog/issues
 - Much of the work-in-progress tasking is being maintained privately on Trello
